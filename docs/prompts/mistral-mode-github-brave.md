# Mistral Model GitHub Training
To generate a Mistral model code assistant trained on a list of GitHub repositories, follow these steps:

## Prepare the Training Data:
* Collect the data from the GitHub repositories you want to train the model on. This can include README files, code snippets, commit messages, and issue descriptions.
* Format the data into a structured format that the Mistral model can understand, such as JSONL files where each line represents a conversation turn or a code snippet.

## Install Required Packages:
* Install the necessary packages for running Mistral models and fine-tuning them:
```pip install mistral-common
pip install transformers
pip install packaging mamba-ssm causal-conv1d
```
## Download and Set Up the Mistral Model:
Download the Mistral model you want to fine-tune. For example, the 7B Instruct model:
```wget https://models.mistralcdn.com/mistral-7b-v0-3/mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.tar
tar -xvf mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.tar
Set up the environment variables for the model path:
export M7B_DIR=$HOME/mistral_models/mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3```

## Fine-Tune the Model:
* Use the mistral-finetune repository to fine-tune the model on your GitHub repository data. Ensure you have the necessary scripts and configurations set up.
* Customize the training parameters such as model_id_or_path, run_dir, seq_len, batch_size, and max_steps according to your dataset and hardware capabilities.

## Run the Fine-Tuning Process:
* Execute the fine-tuning process using the appropriate script. For example:

```python -m mistral_finetune.train --model_id_or_path $M7B_DIR --run_dir $HOME/data/mistral_finetune --seq_len 1024 --batch_size 1 --max_steps 10000```

## Monitor Training Progress:
Use Weights and Biases (W&B) to monitor the training progress and visualize metrics such as training loss, evaluation loss, and learning rate.
## Deploy the Fine-Tuned Model:
Once the fine-tuning is complete, you can deploy the model for inference using the mistral-inference library.
* Set up the environment for inference:
```pip install mistral-common```
* Run the code assistant:
```mistral-chat $M7B_DIR --instruct --max_tokens 256```
* By following these steps, you can train a Mistral model to act as a code assistant based on the content of GitHub repositories.
