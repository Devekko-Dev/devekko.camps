<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to respond to this query. The user wants an AI 
assistant that can generate code to fine-tune DeepSeek-R1 using Ollama on 100 GitHub 
repositories, specifically in Python with FastAPI.

First, I need to understand what each part means. Fine-tuning a model like DeepSeek-R1 
likely involves training it on specific datasets or codebases to improve its 
performance. Ollama is an LLM that can generate text based on prompts, so using it for 
code generation makes sense. The user wants this process to happen in Python using 
FastAPI, which is a framework for building web services.

So, the main goal is to create a system where:
1. The AI assistant downloads and pre-processes 100 GitHub repos.
2. It tokenizes the code (converts it into numerical representations).
3. Fine-tunes DeepSeek-R1 using these tokens with Ollama as the LLM.

The user also mentioned using FastAPI for downloading repos, which probably involves 
making HTTP requests to GitHub's API. Pre-processing might include cleaning up code 
snippets and handling tokenization, likely using Hugging Face's transformers library 
since it's common for NLP tasks.

Next, I should outline how each part works step by step. Starting with downloading the 
repos – that would involve sending GET requests to GitHub URLs. Extracting code from 
repo directories requires navigating through files and extracting relevant ones like .py 
or .md files.

Pre-processing could mean cleaning up the text data—removing unnecessary comments, 
handling different language structures across languages, etc. Tokenization is about 
converting this cleaned text into tokens that can be fed into models; BERT tokenizers 
are often used for this purpose.

Fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1 with Ollama involved preparing a dataset and training it using 
Hugging Face's fine-tune function. This step would require setting up the model, 
defining training parameters, and starting the training process over the preprocessed 
data.

Finally, integrating all of this into a FastAPI app means creating endpoints for data 
upload, preprocessing, model training, and code generation. The user might also want to 
use Streamlit or similar tools for an interface, making it accessible even without deep 
knowledge of coding.

I should structure my answer by breaking down each part: downloading repos, 
pre-processing, tokenization, fine-tuning, integrating with FastAPI, adding an API 
frontend, monitoring and deployment considerations. This way, the user gets a 
comprehensive guide on how to achieve their goal step by step.
</think>

To create an AI code assistant that can fine-tune DeepSeek-R1 using Ollama on 100 GitHub 
repos in Python with FastAPI, we need to break down the process into several key 
components: downloading and preprocessing data, tokenizing it for the model, fine-tuning 
the LLM, integrating it with a web interface using FastAPI, and providing an API 
endpoint. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide.

---

### **1. Downloading GitHub Repositories**

We will use Python's `requests` library to download the source code from GitHub 
repositories. We'll assume we have access to 100 GitHub repositories (or use a test set 
of repos for demonstration).

#### Step 1: Set Up Libraries
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import os
import json
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
```

#### Step 2: Fetch Repositories
We'll create a function to download the code from GitHub. This is a simplified version; 
in practice, you might need to handle different repository types (e.g., `git`, 
`github`).

```python
def fetch_repos.github Wilson, but I think you meant to write "fetch_repos()".

Wait, there's a GitHub action called ` Wilson`, but that seems unrelated. Let me focus 
on the main task.

To download code from GitHub, we can extract files using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. 
However, this approach may not handle all cases (e.g., Gists vs. Repos). For simplicity, 
I'll assume we're working with public Git repositories:

```python
def fetch_github_repos(url_pattern, n_repos=100):
    """
    Fetch the first n_repos from a GitHub URL pattern.
    
    Args:
        url_pattern (str): A string like "https://github.com/username/repo.git"
        n_repos (int): Number of repositories to fetch.
    Returns:
        List: URLs of fetched repos or an error message.
    """
    try:
        # Fetch the first 100 repos' URLs
        response = requests.get(url_pattern)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        
        # Extract repo URLs (modify based on URL structure)
        repo_urls = [a['href'] for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True) if 'blob' in 
a['href']]
        
        # Return first 100 unique repo URLs
        return list(dict.fromkeys(repo_urls[:n_repos]))
    except:
        return "Failed to fetch repos."
```

---

### **2. Preprocessing the Code**

Once we have the code, we need to preprocess it into a format suitable for training an 
LLM.

#### Step 1: Extract Code from Repositories
We'll create a function to extract all files from a GitHub repo:

```python
import subprocess

def get_repo_files(repo_url):
    """
    Extract all .py and .md files from a GitHub repo.
    
    Args:
        repo_url (str): The URL of the GitHub repository.
    Returns:
        List: Paths of extracted files or an error message.
    """
    try:
        # Clone the repository
        process = subprocess.run(['git', 'clone', repo_url],
                                 shell=True, text=True,
                                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                                 stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
        if process.returncode != 0:
            return f"Failed to clone repository: {process.stderr}"
        
        current_dir = os.getcwd()
        try:
            # Change directory to the repo
            os.chdir(os.path.basename(repo_url))
            
            # Extract all .py and .md files
            extracted_files = []
            for file in os.listdir('.'):
                if ('.py' in file or '.md' in file) and not file.startswith('.'):
                    extracted_files.append(file)
                    
            return [f"{os.path.join(current_dir, f)}" for f in extracted_files]
        finally:
            os.chdir(current_dir)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error extracting files: {e}"
```

#### Step 2: Preprocess Code into Tokens

We'll use Hugging Face's tokenization library to convert the code into tokens.

```python
def preprocess_code(code_strings):
    """
    Preprocess code strings into tokens.
    
    Args:
        code_strings (List[str]): List of code strings to tokenize.
    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: Tokenized sequences or an error message.
    """
    try:
        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/MalabTM-2")
        
        tokenized = []
        for code_str in code_strings:
            tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(code_str)
            tokenized.append(tokenizer converts tokens to integers)
            
        return [tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens) for tokens in tokenized]
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Preprocessing error: {e}"
```

---

### **3. Fine-Tuning DeepSeek-R1 with Ollama**

We'll use Hugging Face's `transformers` library to fine-tune the LLM.

#### Step 1: Prepare Training Data

The training data will be the preprocessed code tokens:

```python
def prepare_training_data(tokenized_data):
    """
    Format the preprocessed tokens into training data.
    
    Args:
        tokenized_data (List[List[int]]): Tokenized sequences.
    Returns:
        dict: Training data in Hugging Face's format or an error message.
    """
    try:
        # Convert to Hugging Face dataset format
        return {"input_ids": [tokens for tokens in tokenized_data]}
        
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Failed to prepare training data: {e}"
```

#### Step 2: Fine-Tune the Model

We'll use `transformers`'s `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained` and Hugging Face's 
fine-tuning function.

```python
def fine_tune_model(tokenized_data, model_name="microsoft/MalabTM-2"):
    """
    Fine-tune an LLM on the tokenized data.
    
    Args:
        tokenized_data (List[List[int]]): Tokenized sequences to train on.
        model_name (str): Name of the base model to fine-tune.
    Returns:
        dict: Model config and training output or an error message.
    """
    try:
        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
        
        # Set training arguments
        training_args = {
            "output_dir": "fine_tuned_model",
            "per_device_train_batch_size": 1,
            "num_train_epochs": 3,
            "learning_rate": 2e-5,
            "weight_decay": 0.01,
        }
        
        # Fine-tune the model
        trainer = Trainer(
            model=model,
            tokenizer=tokenizer,
            args=training_args,
            train_dataset=tokenized_data,
        )
        return trainer.train()
        
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Fine-tuning error: {e}"
```

---

### **4. Integrate with FastAPI**

We'll use FastAPI to create a web interface where users can upload code, preprocess it, 
and fine-tune the model.

#### Step 1: Create API Endpoint

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, UploadFile
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

class RepoUploader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_name = "microsoft/MalabTM-2"
    
    async def upload_and_fine_tune(self, files: list[UploadFile]):
        """
        Upload code files and fine-tune the model.
        
        Args:
            files (List[UploadFile]): uploaded code files.
        Returns:
            JSONResponse: Fine-tuning results or an error message.
        """
        try:
            # Get all code strings from files
            code_strings = []
            for file in files:
                content = await file.read()
                code_str = str(content, 'utf-8')
                code_strings.append(code_str)
            
            # Extract files and preprocess
            extracted_files = await self.extract_files_from_codes(code_strings)
            tokenized_data = await self.preprocess_code(extracted_files)
            
            # Fine-tune the model
            output = await self.fine_tune_model(tokenized_data)
            
            return JSONResponse(content={'message': 'Model fine-tuned successfully', 
                                        'model_name': self.model_name})
        
        except Exception as e:
            return JSONResponse(content={'error': f"{e}"), status_code=500)

    def extract_files_from_codes(self, code_strings):
        # Implementation to extract files from code strings
        pass

    def preprocess_code(self, extracted_files):
        # Use pre-trained tokenizer to tokenize the code
        pass
    
    async def create_api(self):
        # Setup FastAPI server
        return app
```

#### Step 2: Run FastAPI Server

```python
from fastapi import Request

@app.get("/")
async def main(request: Request):
    return {"message": "Welcome to the Code Fine-Tuner API"}
```

---

### **Putting It All Together**

Now, we'll integrate all components into a single script.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import json
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, UploadFile
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

class RepoUploader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_name = "microsoft/MalabTM-2"
    
    async def upload_and_fine_tune(self, files: list[UploadFile]):
        code_strings = []
        for file in files:
            content = await file.read()
            code_str = str(content, 'utf-8')
            code_strings.append(code_str)
        
        extracted_files = self.extract_files_from_codes(code_strings)
        tokenized_data = self.preprocess_code(extracted_files)
        output = self.fine_tune_model(tokenized_data)
        return JSONResponse(content={'message': 'Model fine-tuned successfully', 
                                    'model_name': self.model_name})
    
    def extract_files_from_codes(self, code_strings):
        extracted_files = []
        for code_str in code_strings:
            # Use a shell or subprocess to extract files from the string
            # This is a placeholder implementation and may not work as-is
            pass
        
    def preprocess_code(self, extracted_files):
        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/MalabTM-2")
        tokenized_data = []
        for file in extracted_files:
            tokens = tokenizer(file, return_tensors='pt').input_ids[0].tolist()
            tokenized_data.append(tokens)
        return tokenized_data
    
    def fine_tune_model(self, tokenized_data):
        # Use Hugging Face's training function
        pass

@app.get("/")
async def main(request: Request):
    return {"message": "Welcome to the Code Fine-Tuner API"}

# Initialize the RepoUploader
 uploader = RepoUploader()

@app.post("/upload-and-fine-tune")
async def upload_code(files: list[UploadFile]):
    try:
        result = await uploader.upload_and_fine_tune(files)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        return JSONResponse(content={'error': str(e)}, status_code=500)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start FastAPI server
    app.run(host="localhost", port=8000, debug=True)
```

---

### **Notes**

1. **Extracting Files from Code Strings**: The current implementation of 
`extract_files_from_codes` is a placeholder and may not work as-is. You'll need to 
implement it properly using a shell or subprocess to execute the code strings.

2. **Tokenization and Fine-Tuning**: Ensure that tokenization aligns with how Ollama 
expects input tokens (e.g., line endings, formatting).

3. **Security Considerations**: Running FastAPI on port 8000 is generally fine, but you 
should ensure proper CORS setup if accessing from other domains.

4. **Error Handling**: The current error handling is basic. Implement more robust error 
handling and logging for production use.

5. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Depending on the size of your dataset and model, training may 
take significant time and resources.

This code provides a starting point for integrating code file upload, extraction, 
tokenization, and model fine-tuning using FastAPI and Hugging Face's transformers 
library.
