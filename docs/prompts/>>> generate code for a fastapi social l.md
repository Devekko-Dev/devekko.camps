>>> generate code for a fastapi social listening app for x with crewai and langchain o

... a shopify collection
<think>
Alright, I need to help the user generate code for their FastAPI-based social 
listening app called X. The app needs to integrate CrewAI, LangChain with 
DeepSeek Ollama, and Shopify's wine collection.

First, I'll outline what each part of the system does:

1. **CrewAI**: Acts as the conversational interface handling voice commands and 
text messages.
2. **LangChain + Ollama**: Processes user inputs to generate wine 
recommendations.
3. **Shopify Collection Integration**: Fetches wine data based on user 
interactions.

I'll start by setting up the basic FastAPI server structure because that's the 
backbone of any web app built with Python. I know FastAPI is great for building 
APIs, so it makes sense to use it here.

Next, I need to integrate CrewAI. From what I remember, CrewAI provides a REST 
API, so I'll create an endpoint in FastAPI that communicates with CrewAI. This 
endpoint will handle incoming requests from users and send them to CrewAI's API 
to get responses.

Then, for the language processing part, I'll use LangChain to connect with 
DeepSeek Ollama. LangChain allows me to set up a pipeline where user inputs go 
through various models. In this case, it would process the text input to 
generate wine suggestions based on predefined models or APIs from DeepSeek.

After that, integrating Shopify's collection is crucial. I'll create an endpoint 
in FastAPI that fetches wine data from Shopify. This endpoint will take user 
inputs like text or images of wine bottles and use them as filters to retrieve 
relevant products from the collection.

Putting it all together, I'll set up a basic FastAPI server with routes for 
connecting to CrewAI, processing texts using LangChain-Ollama, and fetching wine 
data from Shopify. Finally, I'll write some example clients to test how 
everything works together.

I should also mention deployment considerations like installing necessary 
packages, setting up environment variables, and ensuring all services are 
running on the same domain for a seamless user experience.

Here's a step-by-step guide to generating code for your FastAPI-based social 
listening app:

---

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project

1. **Create a new directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir x-social-listening-app
   cd x-social-listening-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have all required libraries installed.

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn nest-asyncio langchain ollamashops[all] requests
   ```

3. **Create the main file** (this will be your FastAPI server):
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
   from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
   from langchain.llms.ollama import OllamaLLM
   from ollamashops import ShopifyWines
   import nest_asyncio
  nest_asyncio(nest="stagger")
   ```

---

### Step 2: Create the FastAPI Server

```python
app = FastAPI()

# Middleware
app.add_middleware(
    StaticFiles,
    path=".",
    name="static",
   asyg=True
)

@app.get("/")
async def root(request: Request):
    return {"message": "Welcome to X Social Listening App!"}
```

---

### Step 3: Integrate CrewAI

1. **Install CrewAPI**:
   ```bash
   pip install crewapi[calls]
   ```

2. **Create a route for CrewAI integration**:

```python
@app.post("/crewai-integration")
async def handle_crewai(request: Request, req: CrewCalls = None):
    data = await req.text()
    response = await req.crewai("What are people saying about wines?")
    return {"message": "CrewAI Response:", "data": data}
```

---

### Step 4: Integrate LangChain with Ollama

1. **Create a pipeline for language processing**:

```python
from langchain.llms.base import BaseLLM

class OllamaModel(BaseLLM):
    async def query(self, question: str) -> dict:
        response = await self._generate_response(question)
        return {"message": response}

llm = OllamaModel(ollama="deepseek-3-20240110")
```

2. **Create a FastAPI endpoint for text processing**:

```python
@app.post("/process-text")
async def process_text(req: Request, text: str):
    processed_text = req.text()
    
    # Use LangChain to generate wine suggestions based on the model
    response = llm.query(processed_text)
    
    return {"message": "Text Processed:", "response": response}
```

---

### Step 5: Integrate Shopify Collection

1. **Create an endpoint to fetch wine data**:

```python
@app.post("/get-wine-collection")
async def get_wines(wine_filter: str = None):
    shopify_wines = ShopifyWines()
    wines = await shopify_wines.get_wines(wine_filter)
    
    return {"message": "Wine Collection Retrieved:", "wines": wines}
```

---

### Step 6: Run the Server

1. **Start the FastAPI server**:

```bash
uvicorn x-social-listening-app.app:app --reload
```

2. **Visit your domain (e.g., http://localhost:8000)** to test the app.

---

### Example Client Code

Here's an example of how a client could interact with your app:

1. **Connect to CrewAI**:
   ```python
   import requests
   url = "http://localhost:8000/crewai-integration"
   response = requests.post(url, json={"query": "What are people saying about 
wines?"})
   print(response.json())
   ```

2. **Process text through LangChain-Ollama**:
   ```python
   from langchain.llms.ollama import Ollama

   url = "http://localhost:8000/process-text"
   response_text = requests.post(url, json={"text": "People are talking about 
the 2023 Cabernet Sauvignon from Bordeaux."})
   print(response_text.json())
   ```

3. **Fetch wine collection**:
   ```python
   url = "http://localhost:8000/get-wine-collection"
   response = requests.post(url, json={"wine_filter": "red wine"})
   print(response.json())
   ```

### Conclusion

This code provides a basic structure for your social listening app. You can 
expand it by:

- Adding more sophisticated error handling.
- Implementing real-time processing using asynchronous tasks.
- Enhancing the UI with web frameworks like React or Dash.
- Adding authentication and authorization for secure access.

Remember to deploy all services on the same domain (e.g., `localhost:8000`) for 
a fully functional setup.
