Publicly available code LLMs such as Codex, StarCoder, and Code Llama are great at generating code that adheres to general programming principles and syntax, but they may not align with an organization’s internal conventions, or be aware of proprietary libraries.

In this notebook, we’ll see show how you can fine-tune a code LLM on private code bases to enhance its contextual awareness and improve a model’s usefulness to your organization’s needs. Since the code LLMs are quite large, fine-tuning them in a traditional manner can be resource-draining. Worry not! We will show how you can optimize fine-tuning to fit on a single G

fine-tune llm for code generation

Fine-tune LLM for Code Generation
Fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) for code generation involves several steps and considerations. Here's a summary of the key points:

Dataset Preparation: Collect a dataset of code examples relevant to your specific use case. This dataset should include a variety of code snippets and functions that the model will learn from. Ensure the dataset is well-structured and includes examples that represent the coding conventions and patterns you want the model to follow.
Model Selection: Choose an appropriate LLM to fine-tune. Popular choices include models like Code Llama, StarCoder, and Falcon 7B. These models are pre-trained on large codebases and can be fine-tuned to understand specific coding styles and conventions.
Fine-Tuning Techniques: Fine-tuning can be done using various techniques such as instruction tuning, where the model is trained to generate code based on specific instructions and prompts. Other techniques include infilling, where the model learns to complete code snippets, and code-to-documentation generation.
Parameter Tuning: Adjust parameters like temperature, which controls the randomness of the output, and maximum length, which limits the length of the generated code. Experimenting with different parameter settings can help optimize the output for your specific coding task.
Inference and Evaluation: Once fine-tuned, the model can be used for inference. You can push the fine-tuned model to a repository like Hugging Face to share it with your team. For inference, initialize the base model and its tokenizer, then merge the fine-tuned weights with the base model. Define functions to generate code completions based on the model's output.
Reproducibility and Optimization: Ensure that your training process is reproducible by setting a random seed for train-test splitting. Manage computational complexity and memory limitations by using techniques like quantization and model sharding. Optimize model runtime to handle long training times effectively.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model using metrics such as accuracy, speed, and code quality. Compare the generated code with manually written code or known correct examples to measure the model's effectiveness.
For a practical guide on fine-tuning a code LLM on a single GPU, you can refer to the Hugging Face Open-Source AI Cookbook. This resource provides detailed steps on how to fine-tune a model, including merging fine-tuned weights with the base model and using the model for inference.
